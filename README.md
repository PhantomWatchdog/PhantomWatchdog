As a SWE student, i'm currently practicing the basics of several tools :hammer_and_wrench:

* ***Linux*** :penguin:
* ***Vi*** :memo:

## My next projects will concern:
* Linux
  * ***permissions***
  * ***I/O redirections and filters***

After that, i'll work on my first C project :crossed_swords:
